Boilerplate: _noun_ **standardized pieces of text for use as clauses in contracts or as part of a computer program.**

As one of the original authors of Blueprint CSS I've decided to re-factor my ideas into a stripped down framework which provides the bare essentials to begin any project. This framework will be lite and strive not to suggest un-semantic naming conventions. You're the designer and your craft is important.

If you prefer:

```
 { float: left; width: 240px; margin-right: 110px; }
```

over

```
class="column span-2 append-1"
```

then you're in the right place my friend.
